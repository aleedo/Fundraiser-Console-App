# Fundraiser Console App

Fundraising is an innovative way to fund projects and ventures by gathering small contributions from a large number of people, often through online platforms. This console app is designed to facilitate the initiation of fundraising campaigns, providing users with a straightforward and secure means to create, manage, and contribute to projects.

Note: This is a demo of how a fully functional fundraiser console app may be implemented and not a real-world application ðŸ™‚
